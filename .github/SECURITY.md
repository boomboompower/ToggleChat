# Security Policy

Contains basic information for reporting security issues and which versions are currently supported under this policy.

## Supported Versions

|  Version  | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| > 2.0.0   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 2.0.0     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 2.0.0   | :x:                |

**Note:**
Versions of ToggleChat below version 2.0 are no longer supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability with ToggleChat (for any version) is found, please do one of these (in order of preference):
 - Send me an email security(at)boomy.wtf
 - [Create an issue](https://github.com/boomboompower/ToggleChat/issues/new/choose) - *Don't do this for high severity security issues*

#### Afterwards

Reported vulnerabilities will be worked on depending on their severity and spread. If a vulnerability isn't very high level and only effects a small portion of users, a patch may be brought out in a sequencial update. If a vulnerability is severe or targets a large quantity of users/operating systems it will likely recieve it's own update for the patch.

If a vulnerability is deemed insignificant it will not be working on

Most reported vulnerabilities will at some stage recieve a patch; only vulnerabilities outside the mods control will be rejected.
